Consider the following hypothetical situation at a hypothetical college.
Thirty percent of all math majors become computer science majors after one
year. Another 60% become physics majors after one year. After a year, 70% of
the physics majors become math majors and 10% of the physics majors become
computer science majors. In contrast to the other departments, computer science
students are usually very happy: only 20% of them become math majors and 20%
become physics majors after a year.

(a) Draw a graph that describes the situation.

(b) Give the corresponding adjacency matrix.

(c) If a student is majoring in one of these three areas, indicate her probable major after 2, 4, and 8 years
